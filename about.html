    <span class="v7_2">The Customer Service You Have Been Looking For</span>
    <span class="v4_144">We believe that at retroFinds The past should be preserved for future generations to come. When you walk though our doors you should be remined of your childhood and all of the memories of playing videogames with friends family ETC. To keep our business up to these standards we have made our mission to ensure the customers and staff are happy here at RetroFinds below are some of the standards our business likes to follow</span>
    <span class="v4_146">There are so many fakes out being produced that are getting harder to spot as time goes on. Like our memories, we want our old games to be authentic, genuine, and 100% original. We have many checks in place with our last line of defense being RetroFindsâ€™ main Retro Technician, Charles. Charles is a military veteran who takes retro quality and integrity to the highest level, and is an expert on the inside and out of every game and console ever made. Because of this, he has been placed in charge of the refurbishing process and quality control of every item here at RetroFinds. If our games and consoles do not look and function as if they're brand new, we will not sell them.</span>
    <span class="v7_3">Do you need help figuring out what game goes with what system, how to hook up your console to your HDTV, or just want to talk to some really nice people with retro gaming knowledge? You can contact us through call, email, or message us for any issues and you will likely talk to Brandon - our Customer Service Specialist. He loves talking with the Fed-Ex person, the mail carrier, the kid at the drive-thru, and the lady who walks her dog past our office, and will gladly help you sort through any issues. We understand that purchasing things online can be difficult, so we try to sort through any problems before the occur; if they do, we will work to ensure the issue does not happen again.</span><div class="v39_35"></div><div class="v39_36"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="name"></div><div class="v39_44"></div>
